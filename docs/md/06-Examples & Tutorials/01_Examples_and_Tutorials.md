# Examples & Tutorials

This section provides concrete usage examples for various scenariosâ€”CPU-only collectives, shared-state synchronization, PyTorch integration, and fault-tolerant runs where peers may crash or drop out. For more extensive examples, see the `tests/` and `python/examples/` or `python/tests` directories in the repository.

If you want to see how we use PCCL, refer to the open source [prime](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime) repository,
which is our production-ready open source implementation of DiLoCo and async DiLoCo.
